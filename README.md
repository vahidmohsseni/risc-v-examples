# Goals
This repository aims to provide a set of instrucions to get a working Kubernetes cluster on the RISCV64 architecture through K3s. K3s is a K8s distribution, trying to be production ready and easy to install. It is especially suitable for Edge devices. See more : [K3s github repo](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s#k3s---lightweight-kubernetes)

Pre-built binaries can be found in the v1.0 release. Instructions to build everything from source can be found in this repository. Build artifacts can be found in the v0.1 release.

# Get a working K3s cluster on a RISCV64 system

Follow the [Install from zero guide](https://github.com/chefmtt/riscv64/blob/main/install/deploy-k3s-from-zero.md) to launch a RISCV64 system running Ubuntu 20.04 in a virtual machine powered by QEMU, install K3s and its dependencies and start a K3s cluster. If you intend to simply follow the guide, the rest of this README is not important.

The guide targets a QEMU VM, but the binaries should work without any issue on a real system.

The guide targets Ubuntu 20.04. Other Linux distribution supports the RISCV64 architecture : Fedora, Debian, Arch, Gentoo, openSUSE...

## Warning (if you want to use another image)

The Memory Management Unit (MMU) of RISC-V CPUs can have different virtualization schemes. See sections 4.3 to 4.6 of [the RISC-V Instruction Set Manual, Volume II: Privileged Architecture, Version 1.12](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/Priv-v1.12)

The go language did not support SV57 mode for RISC-V, this was fixed after release 1.19. This means that any go program compiled with a go version without the fix will crash when run on a system using SV57 mode. (See [Go issue](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/409055), [commit introducing the fix](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/1e3c19f3fee12e5e2b7802a54908a4d4d03960da).)  
Linux Kernel v5.18 introduced support for SV57 mode. (See [kernel 5.18 changelog](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.18), [concerned commit](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/riscv/linux.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=aa5b537b0ecc16992577b013f11112d54c7ce869).)  

The Debian image found above, for example, is based on Debisn Sid, or unstable. Meaning, the kernel is fairly up-to-date, above v5.18.
QEMU, when launched with the `virt`board, will be in SV57 mode. I think it should be possible to change the MMU mode by launching a board, or using a CPU that does not use SV57 using the --machine and --cpu flags (such as the Sifive Hi-Five Unleashed board, using a U54 CPU), but even when trying that the emulated MMU used SV57 mode in my case.

You can find in the releases a patched [go 1.19 binary](https://github.com/chefmtt/riscv64/releases/download/v0.1/go1.19beta1-264-g1e3c19f3fe.linux-riscv64.tar.xz) which integrates the fix and a version of [Docker](https://github.com/chefmtt/riscv64/releases/download/v0.1/docker-20.10.17_riscv64.deb) built with this go binary.  
**Warning** : The docker package was linked against GLIBC 2.33 and will need to be patched using patchELF to run on a system with an older version, [instrusctions here]() (swap the link to the docker package).

Some useful commands :

```bash
# Check kernel version
uname -r
# Check MMU mode
cat /proc/cpuinfo
# Or
grep --max-count=1 'mmu' /proc/cpuinfo
# Check QEMU's available CPUs
qemu-system-riscv64 --cpu help
# Check QEMU's available boards
qemu-system-riscv64 --machine help
```
